## 🤖 How the Daily AI Sync Works

```
Every night at 3 AM IST (GitHub Actions cron):
  ├── Scrapes BWSSB official portal for new notices
  ├── Downloads PDFs → public/docs/bwssb/ (permanent archive)
  ├── Generates SHA-256 checksums for authenticity
  ├── Auto-updates notices.json (auto-deploys live site)
  └── Tariff revision detected?
        ├── YES → Opens a GitHub Pull Request for maintainer approval
        └── NO  → Done ✅
```

**You (maintainer) just click "Merge" or "Close" on the PR!**

## 🔑 Crowd-Sourced Gemini API Key Pool

### For Browser AI (Ask Namma chatbot):
Citizens can donate their free Gemini API keys via the in-app settings panel. Keys are stored **only in your own browser** (localStorage) and never transmitted anywhere.

### For GitHub Actions (daily sync AI):
Contributors can donate Gemini keys for server-side PDF analysis. Contact the maintainers to add your key as a GitHub Repository Secret (`GEMINI_KEY_1` through `GEMINI_KEY_5`).
